# Theseus Simulator
 
Author: Rainer Glaschick, Paderborn (rainer@glaschick.de)
 
This is a simulator for Claude Shannon's early learning device,
which he called "Theseus".

A film for the mouse in action can be found at [Bell Labs](https://www.bell-labs.com/claude-shannon/assets/videos/Theseus.m4v)

The simulator requires the programming environment [Processing](http://processing.org),
which wants to have the programme in one directory, 
thus the sourcecode is in one.

There you find also a short text with hints how to use.
