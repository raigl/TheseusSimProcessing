How to use the Theseus Simulator

a) Installation

A Java runtime system (version 8) is required in any case.

Either you install the Processing developmen system (https://processing.org/),
and use the source code "theseus.pde" that uses "Fences.pde" and "Maus.pde".

Or you use the ready-to-go binaries, packed in a zip archive.

b) Usage

See enclosed screen image "Start_Screen.png".

In the middle is the maze, showing the memory contents for each field, i.e. direction
the mouse left the square last time.

At the right side are usage hints.

At the top, there is a status line indicating pause, explore or goal mode, field changes so far,
and the turn direction.

At the bottom appears a line if fences are loaded and changed.

To set the mouse position, use the mouse (left click) inside a square,

To set the goal, use a right mouse click inside a square.

To change a fence (barrier), click on it in its middle.

Using the keyboard, other changes can be made:

Space	pause or continue running
Q	Quit the program (immediately, no warning if fences changed)
+, -	quicker and slower
G	get a fence configuration saved with the next command
P	put a fence configuration for later use
D	change turn from clockwise to counterclockwise and vice versa
E, W, N, S: rest all squares to the respective direction (and use exploration mode)

Note that Get and Put currently only save the fences, not other settings.

If the mouse encounters a fence in goal mode, it immediately changes to explore mode,
not turn and an continue, as it should be and will be implemented soon.

In goal mode, after 25 moves the mode is changed to explore mode.
